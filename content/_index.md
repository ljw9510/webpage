description: I am Joowon Lee, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in the fields of causal inference and machine learning. More specifically, my research interest is in developing individual treatment rules which recommend proper treatment according to individual characteristics based on causal effects. I seek methods that can give interpretable results so that they can be widely used and communicated with professionals in broad areas.
